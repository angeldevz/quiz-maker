# Tech Stack

- Framework: 
  - NextJS 
- Styling: 
  - TailwindCSS 
  - Material UI (I am familiar with tailwindCSS but I also wanted to explore MaterialUI so I added this on my styling library)
- Backend Connection: 
  - tanstack query 
  - axios (I know fetch is lighter for this simple app but I use axios for a more simple response handling)
